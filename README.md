Below is an overview of one representative project and supporting code samples that demonstrate my ability to manage data, analyze it programmatically, and develop predictive models. In my ICU Mortality Prediction Project, I worked with a real clinical dataset of over 12,000 ICU admissions from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. I designed a full data pipeline to identify patients at risk of in-hospital mortality. Using Pandas and NumPy, I wrote functions to ingest timestamped data from CSV files, extract meaningful statistical features such as maximum and mean vital-sign values, and handle missing or noisy entries through imputation. I also normalized and standardized variables to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms
